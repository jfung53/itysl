5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,90,No I eat paper all the time!
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,91,What I don't like to make a habit of doing is eating mud pie!
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,92,Why do you even eat paper?!
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,93,That doesn't even make sense!
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,94,Okay you guys calm down!
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,95,This is insane!
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,96,There's a simple solution to this.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,97,Jacob hasn't touched my gift receipt because he likes my gift.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,98,So we just have someone else eat my gift receipt and see if they get sick.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,99,But it can't be Jacob 'cause he's gonna pretend he's not sick even if it's caked in pure shit.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,100,I'll do it.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,101,I'll eat the receipt to solve the problem.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,102,And Jacob doesn't touch it!
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,103,That's right.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,104,And if Melissa gets sick then that means that paper makes you sick.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,105,But if Melissa doesn't get sick then that means Lev ate the mud pie.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,106,There is no mud pies okay?
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,107,And I genuinely like the gifts.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,108,Swear to fucking God?
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,109,Yes.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,110,Then let my wife eat the fucking receipt.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,111,Oka...
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,112,Okay.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,113,I am now sanitizing my hands.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,114,I have not gone to the bathroom yet today.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,115,I took a shower last night after I took a piss and shit.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,116,Now... someone hand me the receipt.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,117,Jacob don't you get anywhere near that!
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,118,How you doing honey?
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,119,I feel... fine.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,120,Paper doesn't make you sick on its own.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,121,He used too small a piece.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,122,Lev's probably not even sick!
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,123,He's probably faking it!
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,124,You son of a bitch!
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,125,Jacob was lying about the mud pie.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,126,And if he was lying about something as simple as grabbing too small a slice that probably means he doesn't like the gift either.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,127,Exactly!
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,128,But you liked my gift right Jacob?
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,129,Yes!
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,130,What about Rick and Melissa's?
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,131,You piece of shit!
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,132,Rick!
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,133,Fuck!
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,134,Somebody call .
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,135,Oh my God.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,136,Tell 'em to send an ambulance.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,137,Tell 'em it's...
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,138,the ugly house on Kenmore.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,139,The one where you can see the KFC sign through their front window.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,140,Happy birthday...
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,141,No! -...to you... Don't let Jacob touch that!
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,142,Everybody let's get out of here.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,143,This place is covered head-to-toe in shit.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,144,All you had to do... was like the gift... and not have a big old mud pie on the bottom of your butt.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,145,It's not a big deal.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,146,You had a big mud pie you had too small of a slice then I ate the mud pie now my stomach's absolutely fucked.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,147,Shouldn't have had such a sloppy mud pie.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,148,Get off me man.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,149,Fine!
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,150,Nobody likes your house anyway.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,151,You should know...
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,152,your wife kissed me on the cheek when I got here.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,153,Now look at you... all alone.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,154,Everybody's going to party at my house.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,155,Happy birthday Jacob.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,156,I just...
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,157,I was just trying not to use a ton of paper towel.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,158,I just hope Lev's all right.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,159,Okay you guys I've got Lev in my car so just follow us.
5,Gift Receipt,gift-receipt,1,1,160,Lev what's your address?
6,Biker Guy,biker-guy,1,2,1,Ohhh!

6,Biker Guy,biker-guy,1,2,12,Two motorcycles with a little house in the middle?
6,Biker Guy,biker-guy,1,2,13,Wow dude!
6,Biker Guy,biker-guy,1,2,14,Wow!

6,Biker Guy,biker-guy,1,2,21,It's got a...
6,Biker Guy,biker-guy,1,2,22,It's got a little house in it.
6,Biker Guy,biker-guy,1,2,23,Come on it's got a little house in it.

7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,2,Hey.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,3,Am I seeing you tonight?
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,4,I don't know Brandon.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,5,I shouldn't even be talking to you.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,6,What's going on?
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,7,You've been avoiding me all week.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,8,You're hiding something.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,9,What happened that night with Riley?
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,10,Look I told you we got in a fight
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,11,and she stormed off.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,12,That was the last I saw of her.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,13,Then why did Tyler see her in your car at 2 a.m.?
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,14,Oh God Tyler!
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,15,Tyler's a freak.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,16,Everybody knows that.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,17,He may be weird but at least he didn't beat up Matt Simms in the locker room in front of everyone.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,18,Okay.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,19,Look... you can't say anything
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,20,but...
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,21,All right you two get to class.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,22,The bell already rang.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,23,You can't be in the hall when the bell rang.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,24,The bell already rang.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,25,Sorry Principal S.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,26,That's okay.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,27,That's a cool shirt.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,28,Yeah it's a TC Topp from TC Tuggers the only shirt that's got a little knob on the front so you can just pull it out when it gets trapped on your belly.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,29,It's very cool.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,30,Yeah I was doing this all the time and the wear and tear was wrecking my regular shirts.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,31,But TC Tuggers has this little knob on the front so you don't wreck your shirt or hurt your hand.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,32,Yeah that makes sense.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,33,Yeah you know what I mean?
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,34,'Cause when you go through the day your shirt gets kind of bunched up so I was wrecking my shirts 'cause I was pulling them out subconsciously but this has that knob so you can just do it easily.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,35,Awesome.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,36,Well we'll get to class.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,37,But they're not a joke.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,38,What?
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,39,You don't make jokes about 'em TC Tuggers.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,40,You don't wear 'em as a joke you don't give 'em as a joke gift or wear them ironically or do pub crawls in 'em like the Snuggie.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,41,They're not like the Snuggie.
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,42,Do they come in other styles?
7,River Mountain High #1,river-mountain-high-1,1,2,43,Not really.

9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,2,Sorry I'm late everyone.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,3,It's very rude of me.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,4,I apologize.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,5,Oh my God
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,6,I farted.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,7,Um...
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,8,Sorry about that everyone.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,9,Could you excuse me for a second?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,10,I have to figure out what's going on.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,11,What the heck?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,12,There's a pink bag on my chair?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,13,Yeah
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,14,it's just a whoopee cushion.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,15,It's a prank.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,16,On me?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,17,No it...
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,18,You know it's just a joke.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,19,What's the joke exactly?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,20,What do you mean?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,21,My farts don't sound anything like that.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,22,My farts are long... and way louder.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,23,And they reek.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,24,So what's the joke?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,25,That I had a milder fart than I normally do?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,26,That nobody's puking from my fart?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,27,Is that the joke?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,28,That I farted and no one barfed?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,29,'Cause that's pretty funny actually.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,30,That'd be a great day for me.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,31,That'd be a great day for me if I farted and nobody barfed.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,32,That's not the joke.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,33,It was just like...
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,34,you know what if you farted?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,35,I think we covered what would happen if I farted Jane.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,36,You'd throw up your pretty little lunch.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,37,Okay everyone I think it's time to start the meeting.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,38,The whoopee cushion thing was stupid.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,39,Uh Dana you wanna bring us up to speed on what's happening in the Midwest division?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,40,Can I just ask...
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,41,what's next?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,42,Just so I know what's next?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,43,Sorry?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,44,Cake batter in my pants and make it look like I cum in my pants?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,45,What are you talking about?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,46,What's the next joke?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,47,Meatball down my leg make it look like my ball sack ripped open?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,48,Brown pie in my undies make it look like I shit my pants?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,49,Brown pudding in my shoes make it look like I shooted diarrhea down my leg?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,50,Make me think I'm mighty sick?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,51,I'm rushed to the hospital and there for hours
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,52,and I miss my family photo tonight.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,53,Is that the joke?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,54,That I miss my family photo tonight?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,55,Nobody wants you to miss your family photos.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,56,Then what's the joke?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,57,That while I'm on the operating table a man is rushed in 'cause he was in a car accident and he has a metal bolt through his head but he bleeds out in the waiting room because the doctors are too busy trying to shove two meatballs in my scrotum and cake batter back in my penis?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,58,Is that the joke... on the man's widow?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,59,You got her Jane.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,60,You really got her.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,61,This is a betrayal on levels that no one's ever seen!
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,62,Permission to go home lie down and watch some TV and rest up so my face isn't beet red for my family photo tonight?
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,63,Yes yes.
9,Pink Bag,pink-bag,1,2,64,Thank you.

11,The Man,the-man,1,2,35,Hush little baby don't say a word Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,36,I'm...

11,The Man,the-man,1,2,39,No...
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,40,but I know you.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,41,It was 1982.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,42,I was 48 you were nine months.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,43,We were on a flight from JFK to London.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,44,Saw you immediately.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,45,A baby on a seven-hour flight.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,46,The first hour was bliss...
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,47,then the crying started.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,48,Small whimpers at first then came the shrieking.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,49,Louder.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,50,Louder.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,51,Louder.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,52,Till it filled the whole cabin.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,53,When I arrived in London I was a shell of a man.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,54,Broken.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,55,You see I had spent my entire life savings to go to London to see my beloved Buckingham Palace so I could see if I could make those soldiers laugh.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,56,Because of you I was too tired to do anything funny!
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,57,And I vowed from that day forward that I would devote the rest of my life to getting my revenge on you little baby.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,58,What are you saying?
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,59,Airline seats?
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,60,Seems like a crapshoot.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,61,Well not if you go through someone's trash.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,62,You went through my trash?
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,63,How do you think I got this?
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,64,Oh my God what is that?
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,65,A rat bit me.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,66,Jesus!
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,67,It's not that gross.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,68,And now here we are...
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,69,the stars aligned.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,70,And now I will exact my revenge.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,71,I'm gonna cry... the whole flight.
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,72,Sir?
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,73,Sir?
11,The Man,the-man,1,2,74,What?!

12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,35,It's Charlie.
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,36,Give it up for him.
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,37,All right ladies and gentlemen the next trick is something that kept me out of college for...
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,38,That was really fun.
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,39,God I'm so full.
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,40,If I didn't have to drive I would have probably took them up on that offer of the bourbon flight.
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,41,That's so cool.
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,42,We should do dancing next.

12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,49,What?
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,50,Why the fuck didn't you stick up for yourself you fucking coward?
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,51,What are you talking about?
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,52,The magician Charlie.
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,53,He embarrassed you.
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,54,What?
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,55,He brought you on stage and he insulted your intelligence.
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,56,He made fun of how you look and you did nothing.
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,57,No he was just joking around.
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,58,He was a funny magician.
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,59,That fat piece of shit made you look like a fool Charlie.
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,60,He basically pulled your little dick out in front of everyone and jerked you off until nothing came out because you are a boy.
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,61,No that is not what happened.
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,62,Look... we will stay married and raise the kids until they're out of the house but I will not respect you and I'll make sure the kids don't either.
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,63,Oh my God
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,64,it was just a magic act Brenda.
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,65,You make ten times what he makes.
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,66,Why didn't you say that to him?
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,67,I don't know if that would've helped.
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,68,Right maybe it wouldn't have helped.
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,69,I'm glad you had fun while everyone else had to watch an adult man jerk your little-boy dick off.
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,70,Jesus Christ.
12,Which Hand,which-hand,1,3,71,Now... Thank you.

17,Lifetime Achievement Award,lifetime-achievement-award,1,4,3,Tonight we honor the life and the music of Mr. Herbie Hancock and if we're lucky we might even get him to come up here and play a little music for us.
17,Lifetime Achievement Award,lifetime-achievement-award,1,4,4,But first I do want to say just for anyone who's concerned I don't think the dog that bit me should get put down.
17,Lifetime Achievement Award,lifetime-achievement-award,1,4,5,I know that's protocol when a person falls and a dog bites them the dog gets put down
17,Lifetime Achievement Award,lifetime-achievement-award,1,4,6,but I don't think the dog should get put down because I know that's a service dog.
17,Lifetime Achievement Award,lifetime-achievement-award,1,4,7,Otherwise why would it be allowed in here and why would it be wearing that little blue shirt?
17,Lifetime Achievement Award,lifetime-achievement-award,1,4,8,Okay I just wanted to say that so it didn't cloud the rest of the evening.
17,Lifetime Achievement Award,lifetime-achievement-award,1,4,9,The year is on the mean streets of Chicago.
17,Lifetime Achievement Award,lifetime-achievement-award,1,4,10,My dog didn't bite you.
17,Lifetime Achievement Award,lifetime-achievement-award,1,4,11,What?

17,Lifetime Achievement Award,lifetime-achievement-award,1,4,25,That's really none of your business.
17,Lifetime Achievement Award,lifetime-achievement-award,1,4,26,That would be true if your dog didn't try to bite the back of my hair off.
17,Lifetime Achievement Award,lifetime-achievement-award,1,4,27,You know what happened.
17,Lifetime Achievement Award,lifetime-achievement-award,1,4,28,I don't.

17,Lifetime Achievement Award,lifetime-achievement-award,1,4,52,You don't tape people.
17,Lifetime Achievement Award,lifetime-achievement-award,1,4,53,What is this society that we tape everything?
17,Lifetime Achievement Award,lifetime-achievement-award,1,4,54,What's going on?
17,Lifetime Achievement Award,lifetime-achievement-award,1,4,55,Do we not live in the moment anymore?
17,Lifetime Achievement Award,lifetime-achievement-award,1,4,56,We just tape everything from a phone?
17,Lifetime Achievement Award,lifetime-achievement-award,1,4,57,I don't like that.
17,Lifetime Achievement Award,lifetime-achievement-award,1,4,58,You know that's what Herbie's music is against.
17,Lifetime Achievement Award,lifetime-achievement-award,1,4,59,I don't know man I think the dog humped you.

19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,2,You know coming from the Midwest I was unsure whether I'd like California or not.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,3,Yeah.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,4,But I got to say I love it.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,5,You know?

19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,12,You excuse me for a second?
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,13,Mm-hm.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,14,Can I talk to you for a second?
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,15,How can I help you?
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,16,My date's eating all the fully loaded nachos.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,17,All the ones with the meat and cheese the ones that are fully loaded she's hogging them
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,18,so I'm mostly getting just like just chips.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,19,Like mostly just chips like nothing on 'em but like a little bit of cheese and maybe one little nugget of meat.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,20,Okay.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,21,Can you say something to her?
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,22,Say what?
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,23,"Maybe go up to the table and just say like ""Hey stop that."""
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,24,"Or like ""Hey that's not allowed."""
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,25,"You want me to go over and say ""Stop eating the meat on the chips""?"
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,26,No just say the restaurant has a rule.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,27,"It's not you, it's a rule the restaurant has that if you get an item to share you can't..."
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,28,One person can't just eat all the fully loaded ones.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,29,Like don't look around find the one with most meat and always eat that one.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,30,Can't you just ask her to share with you?
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,31,Can't you just say the restaurant has a rule?
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,32,I don't know maybe it's just me
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,33,"but I'm like ""Play your hits."
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,34,"Like don't play the new stuff."""
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,35,Yeah I totally agree.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,36,You go to a concert and you want to hear the songs you love.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,37,Right exactly like Give me the good-time rock 'n' roll.

19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,41,This is so fun.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,42,I'm glad we did this.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,43,Are you enjoying everything?
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,44,Yeah everything's great.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,45,Yeah.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,46,Uh Okay.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,47,Because we have a rule here that if you order nachos to share uh one person can't just eat all the fully loaded nachos.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,48,What's that?
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,49,Say that again?
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,50,We have a rule that basically says if two people order nachos to share one person can't take the ones with meat and stuff.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,51,What?
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,52,I've never heard anything like that before.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,53,That is so weird.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,54,But I guess if that's a rule thanks.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,55,Okay.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,56,Hang on a second.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,57,Did you ask him to come over here and say that?
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,58,What?
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,59,Did you ask him to say that?
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,60,What the hell are you talking about?
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,61,You got up you talked to him for a long time and then the minute you sit down he comes over and says that the restaurant has this rule.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,62,No restaurant has a rule about who gets to eat what.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,63,What?
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,64,I went up there to ask if we could switch tables.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,65,There's an air conditioner above this table and I was worried you were gonna get cold.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,66,There's no vent above us.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,67,What?
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,68,Did he ask you to come over and say that about the nachos?
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,69,He did.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,70,What?
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,71,I went up there to complain about the rule.
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,72,You just learned the rule!
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,73,What?
19,Nachos,nachos,1,4,74,He just came over here Who?

21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,4,Someone drove a hot-dog-shaped car through the window!
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,5,The driver's gone.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,6,Somebody call the cops.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,7,We need to find that driver.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,8,They could have killed someone.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,9,Whose car is this?
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,10,Yeah come on!
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,11,Whoever did this just confess.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,12,We promise we won't be mad.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,13,What?
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,14,We'll close our eyes just take your car and get out of here.

21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,17,Someone call the police!
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,18,Yeah that's one idea.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,19,Or we could work as a team find out whoever did this and punish him ourselves.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,20,Maybe take his bare butt out of his costume and spank him.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,21,Maybe you could do it sir.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,22,Not gonna happen.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,23,Okay you.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,24,No.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,25,Well one of us is gonna have to do it.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,26,No one's getting spanked.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,27,You know what's driving me nuts?
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,28,It could literally be any one of us.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,29,Ooh-ooh!

21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,31,You're dressed like a hot dog.

21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,33,Oh no.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,34,Donald might look like a hot dog but you're wearing an actual hot-dog costume.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,35,You know I don't have to sit here and be insulted like this.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,36,I'm just gonna take as many suits as I can grab get in that random hot-dog car Ran-dom! and drive back to Wiener Hall.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,37,Oh my God.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,38,What happened here?
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,39,Yeah.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,40,We're all trying to find the guy who did this and give him a spanking.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,41,It's obviously this guy right?
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,42,Yes.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,43,I have a name.
21,Brooks Brothers,brooks-brothers,1,5,44,What's your name?

29,Baby Shower,baby-shower,1,6,32,For two hundred dollars I could probably get a thousand plastic meatballs.
29,Baby Shower,baby-shower,1,6,33,Maybe we should keep thinking.
29,Baby Shower,baby-shower,1,6,34,Okay.
29,Baby Shower,baby-shower,1,6,35,Oh I know.
29,Baby Shower,baby-shower,1,6,36,What about like one of those little things with soaps and lotions from Bath & Body Works?

29,Baby Shower,baby-shower,1,6,49,They don't even look real!
29,Baby Shower,baby-shower,1,6,50,They look like little pieces of shit!

30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,12,Like Bozo the Clown?
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,13,Have you seen it?
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,14,It's hilarious.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,15,No let's watch it.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,16,"Type in ""Bozo Dubbed Over"" and there's spaces between each of the words."
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,17,Is this it?
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,18,Yes.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,19,It has one view and it says it was uploaded at 6 a.m. this morning.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,20,Have you seen it?
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,21,It's hilarious.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,22,Oh fuck.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,23,What the fuck?
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,24,I'm not even supposed to be here.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,25,I hope I don't jack off.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,26,What is this Reggie?
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,27,I guess it's like a viral video where Bozo dubs over.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,28,Oh fuck a clownputer?
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,29,Fuck that.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,30,Probably got no games.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,31,I hope nobody goes home and fucks my mom.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,32,Hilarious right?
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,33,What the fuck's that?
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,34,Like a little circle?
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,35,Oh fuck!
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,36,I thought this guy's supposed to be bald!
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,37,What is this guy trying to do?
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,38,Is this supposed to be what Bozo's thinking or saying?
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,39,What guy?
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,40,It's Bozo.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,41,Bozo did it.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,42,Bozo did what?
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,43,Bozo did the dub.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,44,He's doing the dub.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,45,Bozo is not a guy.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,46,Um okay.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,47,This guy's about to jack off.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,48,I feel like it makes more sense that a different guy is dubbing over it.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,49,No he's saying what he wanted to say on the show now.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,50,Bozo is.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,51,That's Bozo's voice.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,52,This little fucking bike's a piece of shit.
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,53,Reggie did you make this thing last night so you'd have a video to show?
30,Bozo #2,bozo-2,1,6,54,No.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,1,I thought Mark was doing better.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,2,Well last night Mark fell down and nearly hit his head on the counter.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,3,His drinking has really gotten out of control.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,4,It's hard
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,5,I know.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,6,But if we're actually his friends we have to do this intervention.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,7,I can do Friday.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,8,That works for me.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,9,We could do it at my house.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,10,We could do it at my house.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,11,It's the most comfortable it can fit everyone.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,12,It's the perfect trap.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,13,Plus it's already like a party house so he'll want to go there.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,14,Isn't your house kinda far away?
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,15,Yeah
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,16,but it's like a complete party house.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,17,And bring snacks so it feels like a real party.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,18,"Dawn, chips."
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,19,"Pat, pop."
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,20,"And Jake, why not cook something?"
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,21,Like a hot dip or something.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,22,A hot dip?
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,23,A hot dip or something.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,24,Yeah bring it to my house.

31,Party House,party-house,1,6,33,Take a seat Mark.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,34,Sorry bud no partying tonight.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,35,I'm afraid to say this is your intervention.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,36,What the fuck?
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,37,You're busted man.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,38,No I mean what is happening with your house?
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,39,What the hell is all this stuff?
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,40,Yeah should we do this somewhere else?
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,41,Sit down.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,42,We're not fucking around here.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,43,Right guys?
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,44,That chair reclines by the way.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,45,The tongue sticks out.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,46,"""Mark you used to be my best friend."
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,47,We were like brothers going to the movies together traveling playing sports.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,48,To see something be in control of you and see you drinking it all away.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,49,All Garfield.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,50,"""Do you know how hard that is for me?"
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,51,Brother I love you
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,52,but I can't watch you do this to yourself anymore.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,53,"You need help."""
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,54,Mark your drinking has made you a totally different person.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,55,You've lost your lust for life.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,56,I'll never forget the day that I told you that I bought Jim Davis' house the creator of Garfield.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,57,You just sat there stared at me like I didn't just tell you I bought Jim Davis' house fully furnished!
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,58,And I read the e-mail that you wrote when you were drunk.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,59,I saw how you said I spent all my money on the Jim Davis house.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,60,How I wasted all my money on the Garfield house and how it's all I talk about.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,61,But you know what you didn't say?
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,62,How it came fully furnished.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,63,"""Mark this is the hardest letter I've ever had to write."
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,64,When you showed up at my house at two in the morning drunk off your ass you scared my kids.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,65,"I'll never forget"""
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,66,And I'll never forget when I woke up at 3 a.m. and heard pounding on the door.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,67,It was Jim Davis.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,68,He forgot that he didn't live here anymore.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,69,He came in he pushed me around.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,70,"He goes ""Hey where's the Garfield treasure chest?"""
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,71,"I said ""Dude back off."
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,72,I don't know.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,73,"I didn't touch a goddamn thing."""
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,74,Meanwhile where are you?
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,75,Drunk little bitch you make me sick.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,76,Guys I just looked it up.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,77,Jim Davis never owned this house.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,78,What the fuck are you talking about?
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,79,Who lived here?
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,80,A guy who tried to kill Jim Davis.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,81,So you're saying I spent like three hours in a Garfield-shaped hot tub with a murderer?
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,82,Oh my God!
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,83,It's the guy who tried to kill Jim Davis!
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,84,I'm Garfield.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,85,What is going on?
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,86,I hate Mondays.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,87,I hate Mondays.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,88,I hate Mondays.
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,89,Garfield!
31,Party House,party-house,1,6,90,I hate Mondays.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,1,Hey Pat Dennis is here early so we're gonna meet now.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,2,But it's lunch.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,3,We pushed lunch to 1:30 so Dennis could make the flight to Chicago.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,4,"Oh, 1:30?"
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,5,But it's lunch.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,6,Yeah.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,7,I don't know if you're allowed to do that.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,8,All right I'll jump right into it.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,9,Have to be in a cab in 20 minutes.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,10,The first and most obvious thing we should address is the team restructuring now that Sierra got headhunted.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,11,Now 70% to 75% of corporate workplace transformations fail.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,12,And what's at the heart of those failures?
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,13,The dreaded reorg.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,14,I've been in this business for years and in my observation time and time again after losing a team leader people begin to tune out.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,15,They move in to a protectionist mode.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,16,Let's be really really clear.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,17,Trying to shuffle other team members around willy-nilly isn't gonna work.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,18,That just creates patterns of dysfunctional communication.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,19,Is that a hot dog?
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,20,find ourselves facing another restructuring Pat! Pat! Is that a hot dog in your sleeve?
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,21,Re-evaluate the specific elements that Sierra brought to the table I'm so tired.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,22,and if we pull this off our leverage initiative can not only recreate the success we enjoyed with her at the helm but surpass it.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,23,Pat.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,24,He's eating a hot dog.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,25,What?
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,26,He's eating a hot dog under there.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,27,Pat we know you're eating a hot dog.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,28,I'm not sir.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,29,I'm just like the tiredest I've ever been in my life.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,30,You can see it from here Fuck.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,31,Pat? Pat is choking!
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,32,Stop moving!
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,33,Stop!
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,34,Stop moving!
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,35,He's like a wild animal.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,36,Hold still Pat.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,37,Don't let it break off.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,38,There's no way to suck it out.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,39,Don't pinch the end.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,40,He's trying to choke me.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,41,He's trying to kill me.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,42,You can't skip lunch.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,43,You just can't guys.
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,44,Whose bag is this?
32,Lunch Meeting,lunch-meeting,2,1,45,I almost tripped on it.
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,1,Spectrum is planning to drop channels including Corncob TV.
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,2,They're saying by the end of 2022 Corncob TV won't be available on your cable menu.
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,3,That means you won't be able to see some of your favorite Corncob TV shows including Coffin Flop.
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,4,They're saying they want to drop Corncob TV because we showed over 400 naked dead bodies on our show Coffin Flop.
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,5,"If you love Corncob TV shows it's time to tell Spectrum ""No."""
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,6,"They're saying ""Coffin Flop's not a show."""
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,7,"""It's just hours and hours of footage of real people falling out of coffins at funerals."""
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,8,"""There's no explanation."""
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,9,"""Just body after body busting out of shit wood and hitting pavement."""
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,10,Come on.
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,11,"They're saying ""It's impossible that that many dead bodies are falling out of coffins every day."""
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,12,"""And it's impossible that one out of every five of them are nude."""
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,13,I don't know what to tell you bud.
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,14,We're just shooting funerals and showing the ones where the bodies fly out.
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,15,Jesus!
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,16,"They're saying ""No way."
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,17,"You must've rigged something."""
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,18,I didn't do fucking shit.
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,19,I didn't rig shit!
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,20,I've been waiting a long time for a hit on Corncob TV.
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,21,I didn't fucking do this!
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,22,They say we don't have the family's permission.
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,23,I say we don't need it.
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,24,We're allowed to show 'em nude because they ain't got no soul.
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,25,The guys at Spectrum think I'm just some dumb hick.
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,26,They said that to me at a dinner.
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,27,"Call Spectrum and say ""I'm not worried about it!"""
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,28,"""I'm not worried about any of this."
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,29,"There's worst shit on the local news."""
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,30,This world's fucking so fucked up.
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,31,And people are mad at me because I showed a bunch of naked dead bodies with their spread blue butts flying out of boxes?
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,32,Really?
33,Coffin Flop,coffin-flop,2,1,33,I'm done.

38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,27,I've never been to a store like Dan Flashes where everything in the store I would wear.
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,28,Mike you have to eat.

38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,32,Dan Flashes got a new shirt in today that's four hundred and fifty dollars.
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,33,What?
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,34,'Cause the pattern's so complicated you idiot!
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,35,It costs more because of the patterns.
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,36,Yeah
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,37,and rightfully so!
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,38,This one I'm wearing now?
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,39,This is a hundred and fifty dollars out the door.
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,40,And this is not that complicated.
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,41,They have this one shirt that costs one thousand dollars 'cause the pattern's so wild.
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,42,I want that one so bad.
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,43,Mike we have to focus.
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,44,I'm just not going to let Doug say that about Dan Flashes that the patterns aren't complicated.
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,45,I never said that.
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,46,You said they shouldn't jack up the prices!
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,47,That means that the patterns aren't complicated and they are.
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,48,Even on this one which is bargain bin.
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,49,Okay.
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,50,Still nuts.
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,51,That's not what Doug was saying.
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,52,He kind of is though.
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,53,That's how they value the shirt.
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,54,The more the lines crisscross and the patterns overlap.
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,55,Okay.
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,56,'Cause if you're saying they're not complicated They are.
38,Dan Flashes,dan-flashes,2,2,57,They are.

45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,10,Santa Didn't anybody tell you anything?
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,11,"I told your producers ""Do not mention Christmas or that I do it at all."""
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,12,They told me not to focus on it.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,13,And I told them not to mention it at all.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,14,If Leonardo DiCaprio was here would you ask him about Christmases around the corner?
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,15,Would you like me to interview you as an actor?

45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,19,Unprofessional bullshit.

45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,21,Bullshit.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,22,So Santa how would you describe Detective Crashmore?
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,23,It's a cosmic mix of the action of the 's combined with the exploitation films of the 's but with modern touches.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,24,It's hyper-violence
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,25,but it knows that it is.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,26,It's a little bit Tarantino.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,27,It's definitely a little bit Michael Mann.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,28,It's kind of a cosmic gumbo.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,29,It almost moves to the beat of jazz.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,30,Great.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,31,Yeah
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,32,Ryan
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,33,and I would joke on set about it being a cosmic gumbo.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,34,But uh Let's talk for a second about the nudity in the film.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,35,Was that scary for you as an actor to do?
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,36,Well the script called for it.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,37,It's an important part of Detective Crashmore's journey.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,38,What are we ten years old?
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,39,I've seen every cock on the planet.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,40,I've seen everyone naked.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,41,I'm sorry you've seen everyone naked?
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,42,Yeah see if they got tattoos.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,43,If they do they get no gift.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,44,So if you get a tattoo you don't get anything for Christmas?
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,45,Not that year.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,46,You think getting a tattoo is good?
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,47,No. Getting a tattoo is not good.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,48,I don't care about it but it's not good behavior.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,49,I got paid two mil to play Crashmore.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,50,How does that money help you?
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,51,Well it does because that amount is called my quote.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,52,That's my rate.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,53,So the next film I'm offered they have to pay that same amount.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,54,Even if I do a bad job.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,55,That means as long as I'm offered even one more movie I could get two more mil.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,56,Even if I do a bad job they've got to give me that other two mil.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,57,Okay.
45,Detective Crashmore Press Junket,detective-crashmore-press-junket,2,3,58,Great.

48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,1,Should I toss this in the trash or you have a recycling here?
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,2,You can just throw it in the bin under the sink.
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,3,Or you could put it in the trash hutch that Marcus was going to build on the porch.
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,4,What?
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,5,Are you serious?
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,6,Why say that?
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,7,We come here three times a year when will I build it?
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,8,Jesus Marcus.
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,9,It was just a joke.
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,10,A really funny joke about how I haven't built the trash hutch.
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,11,Thank you.
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,12,Ugh.

48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,21,I'll be right back.
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,22,I think I might be able to help.
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,23,I should probably get up and start getting dinner ready.
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,24,What?
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,25,Was that a joke?
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,26,I honestly can't tell with you.
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,27,What the hell is he doing?
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,28,What the fuck is he doing?

48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,34,but she can't.
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,35,She thinks he's a new guy 'cause of the glasses and the hat.
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,36,What do you mean?
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,37,'Cause of the hat and glasses.
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,38,She's thinks that he's a new guy.
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,39,Can you take the hat and glasses off?
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,40,No.
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,41,Damn it!

48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,45,Something spooked her.
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,46,It's Lisa's fuckin' boyfriend.

48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,52,Marcus can you please calm the dog down?
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,53,She's scaring my kid!
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,54,It's her house
48,Friends Weekend,friends-weekend,2,4,55,she's doing what's right!

49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,25,here it is.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,26,They sell pants with little dots on 'em.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,27,That's got nothing to do with piss.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,28,Oh okay.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,29,Sorry.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,30,Thought he dropped a few drops of pee.

49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,32,That ain't the case here.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,33,That ain't piss.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,34,That's got nothing to do with piss.

49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,38,Uh thanks
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,39,but I didn't buy these pants like this.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,40,I know.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,41,You can't buy those pants.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,42,Those pants don't exist.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,43,They don't?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,44,It's just a website that says that these kinds of pants exist.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,45,Wouldn't you agree that's all you need?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,46,I don't know.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,47,If Glen thinks that they sell those kinds of pants he can't prove that you got piss on your pants or that you just own these kinds of pants.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,48,It's the perfect thing.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,49,I guess.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,50,What happens if you try to buy the pants on that website?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,51,They all say they're out of stock.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,52,That also makes it seem like it's a hot item.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,53,It's the same thing Supreme does wouldn't you agree?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,54,I guess.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,55,But you gotta give.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,56,I'm sorry?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,57,You gotta give.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,58,Calicocutpants com is completely user funded.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,59,That means no banner ads no paywall.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,60,It's completely user funded.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,61,So you pay to keep it active?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,62,It's just like PBS.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,63,Anyone can use it but if nobody gives it goes dark.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,64,Rick the guy who started this thing he's completely under water.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,65,He can't get a grip on this thing.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,66,So it's only right if you use something to give right?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,67,Yeah.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,68,Hey hold that door!
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,69,Hold that door!
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,70,Hold that door!
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,71,Did you give?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,72,Oh.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,73,Uh hey.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,74,No not yet.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,75,If people use it and they don't give it could go dark.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,76,So one more time it's that we give money to the website to keep it active even though it doesn't actually sell pants?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,77,What are you thinking?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,78,If people find out they don't sell the pants the whole thing falls apart.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,79,What are you doing?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,80,So no one can hear they don't sell pants.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,81,The whole thing relies on the users giving and the users being discreet about that they don't sell the pants!
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,82,But you gotta give!
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,83,I'll give.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,84,Jesus!
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,85,Do it now.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,86,I'll do it later.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,87,I promise.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,88,At least open the tab
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,89,so I know you won't forget.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,90,Calicocutpants com.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,91,Yeah.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,92,Okay there.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,93,I gotta get back to work.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,94,Hey everybody it's Rick here from calicocutpants com and I want to thank you so much for giving to our website.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,95,And if I'm being honest this thing has completely blown up in my face.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,96,This ain't my main gig it's my side gig
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,97,and I can't really get a hold of this on any end.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,98,What is this?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,99,This is auto play.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,100,Things in my life are not going good.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,101,Rick explaining what's happening with the company.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,102,Why it's important to give.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,103,I'm a dead man walking.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,104,I got no time left.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,105,I'm only eating burgers the only thing I can afford.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,106,How do you turn it down?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,107,Put the volume down.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,108,It's not working.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,109,"Try the little ""X""!"
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,110,Quite simply it's just like PBS.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,111,I didn't even ask to use it.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,112,But you did use it.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,113,It helped you out of a jam with Glen.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,114,So now you gotta pay.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,115,Hey!
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,116,Hold that door!
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,117,Hold that door!
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,118,Give.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,119,Hey Jeff here's that thing you asked for that paper.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,120,You gotta give.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,121,Man I'm trying to work here.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,122,I told Rick you're a man of honor.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,123,And I owe Calico Cut Pants a lot.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,124,When my wife was in the hospital I was very distracted.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,125,I was taking four seconds on a six-second piss and letting the last two seconds straight down my leg.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,126,What?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,127,And it helped to know I had the trapeze net of the site so I could focus on what I really needed to focus on which is to be there for my wife and answer the questions for the doctors.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,128,Like what did she go near?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,129,Or on a hike did she walk too close to a tower?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,130,Or I don't know not this probably but did she eat a battery?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,131,Rick knew I wasn't gonna give that month and he barely hounded me.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,132,I'm sorry.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,133,What?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,134,What was wrong with your wife?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,135,She had eaten a battery a little battery like a circle battery like a watch battery.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,136,Oh.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,137,You gotta give!
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,138,Hey!
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,139,If you use something and you don't give Give.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,140,To.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,141,The system.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,142,Hey Debbie
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,143,what's going on?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,144,You wore that dress yesterday.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,145,My God.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,146,I'm the Rock.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,147,"Mike ""The Rock"" Davis from the W Doh W."
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,148,If you used calicocutpants com and you don't pay then you're the problem!
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,149,And if you watch my matches then you know that I don't like problems!
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,150,There you are.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,151,Did you give?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,152,What the fuck?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,153,Get the fuck off my shirt man!
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,154,This is mine!
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,155,The volume on that video wouldn't turn down.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,156,Did you push volume down?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,157,Yes.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,158,I don't know what to tell you.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,159,I don't do volume stuff.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,160,Did you give?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,161,No don't send me videos of loud wrestlers.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,162,When you donate it doesn't go to that!
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,163,What?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,164,The money doesn't go to the video.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,165,"Rick didn't pay Mike ""The Rock"" Davis to do that video with donation funds like people are saying."
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,166,Mike did that video for free.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,167,They grew up together Rick and Mike on the same street.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,168,They lost their virginity the same night at a party at the same house.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,169,What the fuck are you talking about?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,170,If your wife ever goes to the hospital you'll be happy you gave!
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,171,She just keeps eating batteries.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,172,"She says she's not eating them then we go to the doctor the doctor says ""Yeah we found a battery in there."""
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,173,Yeah.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,174,Okay fine
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,175,I'll give.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,176,You owe me a new shirt too.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,177,What?
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,178,You hit me in the cup and you grabbed my shirt.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,179,You stretched it out it looks like a bell now.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,180,You can't do that!
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,181,Okay fine I'll get you a new shirt.
49,Calico Cut Pants,calico-cut-pants,2,4,182,I wish I never told you about calicocutpants com.

52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,79,It's mine.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,80,There's no cute restaurants in the neighborhood.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,81,What?
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,82,Look we don't want to insult you but since it was a joke he got the low price point which we now know means at Star Wagon Or Stable of Stars.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,83,That you allow them to hit.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,84,They're not allowed to hit.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,85,Oh right.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,86,Yes at that price point yes they are allowed to hit.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,87,I'm sorry I don't know what I'm saying.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,88,Understanding all of that we were just hoping that maybe there's another version of this where everyone kind of gets what they want.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,89,I know it's not your fault.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,90,What the fuck are you doing?
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,91,Who is that?
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,92,That's my George Kennedy.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,93,I brought him here as a perk.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,94,Why would I want George Kennedy?
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,95,I know.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,96,That's why he's a perk.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,97,And that's also why he can't hit!
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,98,He can't hit.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,99,Carson can hit all the day he wants.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,100,Can he hit vases?
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,101,Uh Yeah he can.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,102,I like that they can hit.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,103,It's cool.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,104,Okay.

52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,108,Thank you.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,109,Is he with you?
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,110,Busted.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,111,That's my George Bush.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,112,What the fuck are you doing?
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,113,You can't hit!
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,114,Both of you go sit in the wagon.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,115,I'd send 'em to a coffee shop or something
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,116,but there's nothing in this area.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,117,It's a really nice neighborhood.
52,Joanie's Birthday,joanies-birthday,2,5,118,Oh my God the Carson just passed out.
53,Dave Campor,dave-campor,2,5,1,So you're thinking about becoming a owner of your own Little Buff Boys Corporate Competition?
53,Dave Campor,dave-campor,2,5,2,Well I may have a little good advice for you.
53,Dave Campor,dave-campor,2,5,3,Absolutely do it!
53,Dave Campor,dave-campor,2,5,4,I'm Dave Campor Little Buff Boy Champ of '96.
53,Dave Campor,dave-campor,2,5,5,Twenty-five times out of the city run.
53,Dave Campor,dave-campor,2,5,6,I still think I should have won in Tucson.
53,Dave Campor,dave-campor,2,5,7,God I miss those days.
53,Dave Campor,dave-campor,2,5,8,But now my muscles are up here as I run one of the most successful Little Buff Boy franchises out here in Cincinnati.
53,Dave Campor,dave-campor,2,5,9,Now I eat at some of the best restaurants in town.
53,Dave Campor,dave-campor,2,5,10,I get full to the brim eating cherry chuck salad.
53,Dave Campor,dave-campor,2,5,11,People say that it's healthy but with that much cherry and that much ground chuck it can't be healthy.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,1,Wow.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,2,This place is amazing.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,3,Look at all the attention to detail.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,4,I did think it'd look a little more galactic didn't you?
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,5,I think it looks very galactic.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,6,You do?
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,7,You wanna leave?
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,8,You too scared?
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,9,No it's fun.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,10,Oh that's great.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,11,A buddy told me about this place.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,12,He said it was nuts.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,13,Fucker.

54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,17,Hey wait a minute.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,18,My drink's smoking.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,19,We gotta send this back.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,20,I gotta talk to the captain.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,21,Gary you're being so silly.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,22,I'm just having fun.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,23,Uh Seriously though you were saying the trouble you have with your sister.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,24,Oh Gary.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,25,It just keeps piling on.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,26,Every time we think we're out of the woods she just falls right back into her old habits.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,27,It must be so difficult for you Jeanine.

54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,36,It's like CGI.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,37,The money going into this place.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,38,Hey what's an alien gotta do to get a drink around here?
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,39,I just came from a planet that was all bugs.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,40,And I can safely say a lot better-looking than this crowd.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,41,Shit.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,42,Whoa!
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,43,I came here looking for intelligent life
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,44,and I can tell you right now it ain't at table seven.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,45,Oh!
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,46,"They're like ""Huh?"""
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,47,I came here looking for the perfect specimen to abduct.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,48,Hey table three.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,49,Uh hard pass.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,50,Oh!
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,51,"""Hard pass."""
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,52,Brutal.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,53,That is nuts.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,54,Anyways my friend Bruce is going through the same thing that your sister's going through.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,55,Guy had everything.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,56,Look at table five.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,57,"She's thinking ""I should've swiped left."""
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,58,Not right now buddy.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,59,Okay.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,60,If this date were a movie it'd be Bore of the Worlds.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,61,You have no clue.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,62,Talk about abduction someone abducted all the fun from this date.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,63,Her sister's addicted to drugs.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,64,Okay?
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,65,Does that sound boring to you?
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,66,What?
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,67,That's what we're talking about.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,68,It's okay.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,69,I'm sorry if that's the most boring thing you've ever heard that she's scared because her sister loves drugs so much that she can't stop taking them!
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,70,I didn't know.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,71,Exactly.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,72,You know nothing about her.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,73,This woman's been through absolute hell.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,74,Just to get school supplies her mom had to drink puke for a local morning radio show.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,75,Did you know that?
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,76,What?
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,77,She knew that every little pencil she broke her mom had to take another big gulp of vomit for the Davy and Rascal Show.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,78,Does that sound boring to you?
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,79,She did it more than once?
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,80,She had a standing invitation.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,81,And the listeners loved it when she drank stuff.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,82,And she did it for us just so we could get school supplies and trips to Florida.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,83,Does that sound boring?
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,84,No.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,85,I'm sorry if the most boring thing you ever heard is my mom drank puke for trips to Florida.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,86,One time she drank a jar full of mucus just so she could get a backpack.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,87,Right?
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,88,Yeah.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,89,Oh my God.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,90,She drank diarrhea.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,91,No she didn't.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,92,Thought you said that.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,93,Could've sworn you said it in the car.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,94,No.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,95,Look.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,96,I was joking when I said you were boring.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,97,You said I'm boring?
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,98,No no no.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,99,I watched my daddy get executed by the state for homicide dude.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,100,What?
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,101,"Right before they zapped him he looked me right in the eyes and at the top of his lungs he screamed ""Never let the party die!"""
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,102,Does that sound like a boring guy to you?
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,103,It doesn't.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,104,You have no clue what people have gone through or who they are.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,105,So don't say I can't please a woman.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,106,I didn't say that.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,107,You said I should have swiped left.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,108,You did.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,109,What's that supposed to mean?
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,110,I didn't say anything about that.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,111,It's all right.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,112,All you gotta do is take your head out of that head and come over here and apologize to us face to face.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,113,Anyways let's just try to have a good time.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,114,I'm gonna get some mozzarella sticks.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,115,That sounds good.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,116,They have terrific soup.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,117,I'm sorry.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,118,Who the fuck are you?
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,119,I'm that.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,120,Oh!
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,121,Oh okay.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,122,Yeah.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,123,Well okay.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,124,In retrospect I can appreciate that you may not have had any idea that we were here talking about how her sister is addicted to drugs.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,125,I can barely hear anything out here.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,126,Right.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,127,Yeah I bet.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,128,Sweetie you got a little Mars cocktail on your beautiful gray dress there.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,129,Could we get that for free?
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,130,What?
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,131,The Mars cocktail.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,132,Could we get it for free 'cause she spilled a bit on her dress?
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,133,Sure.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,134,Great.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,135,'Cause if you said no I would've gone home and got on Yelp and said that I found a LEGO head in my corn.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,136,I've done that to a lot of places.
54,Mars Restaurant,mars-restaurant,2,5,137,It works.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,1,What the fuck did I do?
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,2,Luca.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,3,Yes Miss Tulving.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,4,Just tell me what happened here.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,5,I fucked up.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,6,That's what happened.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,7,I fucked up.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,8,I found a guy who looks just like Dave who can take huge dumps so people would think Dave was taking huge dumps.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,9,Why did you do that?
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,10,I don't know.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,11,I mean ultimately I guess I wanted people to think Dave was taking huge embarrassing dumps.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,12,If I had to come up with a reason that would be it.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,13,And honestly that might be it.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,14,This guy barely looks like Dave.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,15,From the back he does.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,16,When he hugs the wall and crab walks from the back he does.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,17,With all due respect it worked times.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,18,Oh my God.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,19,How long have you been doing this?
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,20,What do you want me to do?
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,21,Luca you're gonna have to start taking this seriously.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,22,I am serious ma'am!
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,23,I'm serious as a heart attack!
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,24,I didn't do this!
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,25,What?
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,26,You know what the fucked up part is?
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,27,I think part of me wanted to get caught.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,28,I was sick of the cat and mouse game because Dave you're no Tom.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,29,It was just Jerry running around the house doing whatever he wanted sniffing the wife's panties.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,30,I don't think Jerry ever sniffed anybody's panties.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,31,You weren't with him / in the cartoon.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,32,You don't think that a little piece of food ever got caught in the underwear drawer and he took a whiff?
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,33,Jesus Luca come on.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,34,Could I just have a few moments to collect my thoughts?
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,35,"What the hell dude I already told you ""No."""
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,36,Trying to sell my bike stand.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,37,And this guy lives like miles away.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,38,He wants to meet me halfway.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,39,"I'm like ""Hell no!"""
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,40,"""No way dude."
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,41,"You live like so far."""
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,42,"""Come to me."""
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,43,Luca.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,44,I think I just need some time at home.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,45,Look inside myself be with my family and try new restaurants.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,46,Dave do you want to speak to how this has impacted you?
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,47,I guess I'm just a little confused.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,48,Well it's really pretty simple.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,49,Every time you would get up from your desk I would call Rodney.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,50,He'd come here and do his business.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,51,He lives really close to here in like a little shithole.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,52,Am I in trouble?
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,53,That's your voice?
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,54,I've never talked to him.
55,Dave Suit,dave-suit,2,6,55,His voice is wildly high.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,1,Now everybody in here knows or has heard about the dangers of driving while inebriated.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,2,But some of the things people do every single day can be just as dangerous.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,3,Now I'm going to show you a video of a woman who got so wrapped up with a problem at work that she puts herself and others in danger.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,4,Now these videos are a little old.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,5,They look a little dated.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,6,I don't want to hear any jokes about them and don't let the style distract you.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,7,And I don't want any questions about the tables!
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,8,All right.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,9,Yep honey
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,10,I'll be home from work soon.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,11,I'm just picking up my last table.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,12,What the hell did Eddie do to my table?
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,13,It's filthy.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,14,Oh my God.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,15,What the heck?
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,16,It's so dirty.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,17,These are my livelihood.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,18,Hey man I just got my table back.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,19,And I don't know what the hell Eddie Munster did to my table.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,20,It looks like he stepped on them or I know it's not this it looks like he threw them in a mud puddle.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,21,These tables are how I buy my house.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,22,They keep my house hot.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,23,If I were a farmer and Eddie Munster came in and started kicking my corn you could understand how I could be a bit upset.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,24,Do you understand the tables are my corn?
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,25,Whoa!
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,26,Wow.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,27,Pretty serious.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,28,Any questions?
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,29,Yeah.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,30,What was her job?
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,31,Tables.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,32,What do you mean?
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,33,Guys what did I say?
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,34,Her job is so confusing.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,35,The job isn't important.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,36,It's just a generic job that the writers of this made up for this.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,37,But what is the generic job?
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,38,Just tables.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,39,And dealing with Eddie Munster.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,40,She shouldn't have yelled at Eddie.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,41,She actually didn't yell at Eddie Munster.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,42,I've seen this a ton of times.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,43,What does she do?
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,44,Tables!
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,45,But how is tables a job?
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,46,I cannot hear any more about tables.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,47,All right I'm gonna show you a whole new video
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,48,and I want you to tell me what the person in the video did right or wrong.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,49,It's the same woman.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,50,I just got screamed at by Freddy Krueger.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,51,"All I said was ""What did you do to my table?"""
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,52,"""It's filthy."
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,53,"You should be ashamed of yourself."""
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,54,"""You're a fucking pig."""
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,55,And that's when he snapped.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,56,I thought he was gonna kill me.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,57,I'm so mad about this.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,58,Fuck!
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,59,They're so dirty.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,60,Wow.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,61,Pretty crazy.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,62,What'd she do wrong?
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,63,What is her job?
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,64,Tables!
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,65,Do you want me to turn the lights off?
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,66,Everybody puts their heads down.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,67,Nobody gets their license gotta walk everywhere.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,68,Gotta walk to the food store the house.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,69,I'm gonna show you one more video.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,70,Is it the same woman?
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,71,Same actress.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,72,Don't know if she's supposed to be the same person.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,73,Save your questions till the end.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,74,Ugh!
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,75,What the hell happened to them?
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,76,I'm so mad about that.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,77,Hey!
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,78,What's up Carrie?
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,79,Not now George.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,80,I heard you had some problems with your tables.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,81,Go to hell George.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,82,You fucking pig!
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,83,You don't know how to treat the customer.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,84,You don't know how to treat the crypt keeper.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,85,Come on!
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,86,Go!
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,87,If you're gonna keep renting tables to comic-cons and horror-cons you better learn how to treat the talent.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,88,Oh my God that's why.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,89,Shut up!
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,90,This is the maddest I've ever been!
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,91,Any questions?
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,92,Why is there swearing?
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,93,They didn't.
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,94,"All they said was ""shoot."""
56,Driver's Ed,drivers-ed,2,6,95,Don't laugh!
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,1,Something smells.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,2,Tammy did you have an accident?
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,3,No.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,4,Let's just keep playing.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,5,Are you sure?
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,6,I swear to God it wasn't me.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,7,Let's play and forget about it.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,8,I love Tammy Craps.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,9,I'm pounds.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,10,I'm pounds and Tammy Craps is my favorite doll.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,11,That's right girls.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,12,Start packing on those pounds.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,13,The only doll that poops then lies about it doesn't have farts in her head anymore.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,14,What?
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,15,Tammy Craps doesn't have farts in her head.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,16,Does she still lie?
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,17,She still craps.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,18,She still lies.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,19,They just fired the guy that was farting in all the doll heads at the factory.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,20,Don't those dolls have farts in their head?
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,21,They used to.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,22,The disgruntled employee who was farting in the heads was upset the company was treating their full-time employees as contract employees.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,23,Now that the heads are sprayed with a deodorizing poison the farts isn't a problem anymore.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,24,See?
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,25,They ain't got farts no more.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,26,Oh I see.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,27,Can I play with it?
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,28,How many pounds are you?
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,29,I think pounds.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,30,Ooh.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,31,Sorry hon.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,32,Being under lbs and holding a Tammy Craps doll is like smoking five Macanudo Cigars a day.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,33,That's a lot.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,34,No.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,35,Yeah.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,36,It's a good way to decompress.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,37,Lighting one up.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,38,Kids over lbs Like me.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,39,have a body density that can withstand the low low dose of premium-grade poison they spray in the Tammy Craps' heads.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,40,You gotta get out of here little girl.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,41,This for you is like smoking five Macanudos.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,42,Bye hon.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,43,Mom!
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,44,I'm lbs.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,45,I knew you could do it.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,46,Don't put rocks in your pockets and lie about your weight just to get a Tammy Craps.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,47,That can be very dangerous.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,48,Almost as dangerous as having five of these beautiful hand-rolled Macanudo Cigars.
57,Tammy Craps,tammy-craps,2,6,49,That smells good.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,1,And that takes care of addendum four.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,2,How's everybody doing?
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,3,Great.

58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,24,Watch out for the spray!
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,25,I'm digging it.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,26,Groovy girls.

58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,39,More spray!
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,40,Here comes a big wave!
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,41,What the hell man!
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,42,Ah!
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,43,My leg!
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,44,Napkins.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,45,I need napkins.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,46,Can you hear me honey?
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,47,Can somebody move this chair?
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,48,I need a wet paper towel.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,49,Russell you could've killed Paul.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,50,What is wrong with you?
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,51,Fucking psycho.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,52,What happened here?
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,53,Ask Russell.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,54,Russell?
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,55,What happened?
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,56,We were joking around again sir.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,57,And it went too far.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,58,Just like it always does.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,59,Someone always gets hurt.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,60,Just like when I almost killed myself when Julie gave me chode jeans.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,61,What?
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,62,Like when I turned
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,63,"and I said ""No gag gifts"" and Julie gave me chode jeans and I almost killed myself."
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,64,"What are ""cho"" jeans?"
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,65,Chode jeans.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,66,They're jeans for a chode.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,67,A size waist inch legs fucking junk.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,68,Julie gave them to me.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,69,It was just a joke.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,70,I almost killed myself Julie!
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,71,Russell you need to let go of that birthday.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,72,Because it's a long time ago.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,73,It's just hard for me to accept chode jeans from Julie when her husband's loaded.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,74,I mean you're not shy about that that your husband's loaded right?
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,75,We've all seen him.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,76,He's a bit older doesn't look that good right?
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,77,I'm not saying anything you're not completely open about right?
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,78,I shouldn't have got up on that desk.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,79,Yeah you're right.
58,Big Wave,big-wave,2,6,80,My husband is very good-looking.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,1,Julie.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,2,Hi.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,3,Hi.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,4,We're getting our ears pierced but she's a little scared.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,5,Aw there's nothing to be scared of.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,6,We have a little video for you to watch that will put you at ease.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,7,Great.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,8,Right this way.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,9,Thank you for making Claire's the worldwide choice for ear piercing.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,10,Getting your ear pierced for the first time can be an exciting but also sometimes scary experience.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,11,Lot of girls in my class have their ears pierced but I was a little nervous.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,12,I'd always wanted earrings but I really don't like needles.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,13,I always wanted an earring.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,14,But I was so nervous.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,15,The night before I made a mess in the bathroom.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,16,I had to jump in the tub.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,17,But at Claire's they were so nice.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,18,They understood I was nervous and made me feel okay.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,19,We're going to Florida
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,20,and I really wanted an earring for Florida.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,21,But I was nervous to the point of diarrhea.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,22,At Claire's your comfort is our priority.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,23,They let my mom sit with me the whole time.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,24,I had Jessica
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,25,she was in college and was really cool.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,26,I had Chloe.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,27,She was really cool.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,28,She stood outside the bathroom and assured me no one could hear the splashes.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,29,I know all this already.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,30,I am not nervous.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,31,I was a little scared I was going to die on the slab.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,32,Like my dad.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,33,This shit is for babies for little kids.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,34,I know this already.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,35,God damn it.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,36,They had stars they had unicorns.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,37,I had such a hard time choosing.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,38,A couple of years ago I ordered my wife a Sybian.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,39,Hello?
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,40,Do I have to sit here and watch this whole thing?
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,41,I know all this already.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,42,I'm not nervous at all.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,43,Finish the video if you want to get your ear pierced.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,44,All right then.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,45,Go!
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,46,Get out of here.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,47,Let me watch this.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,48,We were just to the point where we were more friends than lovers.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,49,All my friends have their ears pierced.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,50,Now I do too.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,51,It's just another way to express myself.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,52,Sometimes I put my dad in JibJab videos so he's alive again.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,53,I showed it to my mom.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,54,"She said ""Where is he?"""
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,55,This is so boring.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,56,"I go ""Mom it's not real."
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,57,"It's a JibJab."""
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,58,It's just hard.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,59,To see the people who cared for you as a baby become a baby themselves.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,60,They showed me how to clean my ears so they didn't get infected.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,61,They gave me an ice pack to help with the swelling.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,62,Life's a fucking funny thing.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,63,You know if it's true that when you die you get to go back through your life and relive all the moments for eternity then I want some moments in there where I'm just dying laughing.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,64,I fake laugh every day for ten minutes so that when I die and relive life's little moments all I see is happy times.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,65,Ain't that the fucking saddest thing you ever heard?
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,66,I'm sitting in an empty room laughing my ass off to trick my dead self.
59,Claire's,claires,2,6,67,I had a great life.

60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,36,"Music, apps, games, obviously."
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,37,"A medieval game, obviously."
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,38,Obviously a jousting game.
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,39,I have no problem being on my phone for hours.
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,40,I love my phone.
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,41,I even have an alarm on my phone.
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,42,What are you doing?
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,43,Don't cough.

60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,45,It's black
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,46,and I have a black case for it.
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,47,It looks really cool.
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,48,I have everything on this phone.
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,49,I always just look at it.
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,50,"If I ever feel weird at all, I'm just looking at it."
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,51,I know there's a new phone coming soon.
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,52,But I'm not worried about it at all.
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,53,"Because I know I can take all the stuff from my old phone and put it on my new phone, as long as I'm updated."
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,54,I'm putting the photos from here on my computer.
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,55,"That way, when the new phone comes out, I can put them on that phone from the computer."

60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,57,Admit that I won.
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,58,Let me look at this!
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,59,You're just embarrassed because you thought...
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,60,"No, my mom's getting robbed."
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,61,And she's texting you about it.
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,62,The guys are.
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,63,What are they texting?
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,64,Sent me a picture of her tied up with an apple in her mouth.
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,65,Let her go.
60,Barley Tonight,barley-tonight,3,1,66,I love how this phone works.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,1,"Okay, so building a good team in business is like building any team."
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,2,Even the Cardinals.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,3,"For example, uh, Susan."
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,4,And Tina.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,5,They have a shorthand.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,6,You might want to put them on the same team together.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,7,Right?
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,8,"Now on the other hand, let's say if, uh, Rick and Stan are absolute mortal enemies, you probably don't want them on the same team."
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,9,All right?
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,10,"Hate you, Rick."
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,11,"You too, Stan."
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,12,Exactly.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,13,See?
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,14,Wouldn't be a good idea.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,15,You wanna keep close tabs on interpersonal relationships in the workplace.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,16,Now... fuck in' Rick.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,17,Looks like these guys have something going on.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,18,Yeah.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,19,Maybe he walked in on me in a dream when I was about to have an orgy and he wrecked it.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,20,Could be different reasons.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,21,Yeah.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,22,Good.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,23,Okay.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,24,"So, moving forward, uh, you've got a solid handle on these individual personalities and abilities of your core team."
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,25,You can start to delegate tasks...
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,26,"Why the hell did you have to walk in on my orgy, you fucker?"
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,27,All right.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,28,"...and trust takes time, right?"
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,29,So don't fret if things take a while.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,30,"Hey, mortal enemy."
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,31,Okay?
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,32,Need to be nurtured.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,33,"You can't just set and forget them, no matter how talented you people are."
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,34,I'm so pissed off.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,35,But don't suffocate your squad with constant hovering or micromanaging.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,36,Stop.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,37,Make sure everyone's short and long-term goals are laid out clearly and reasonably.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,38,"Even then, things won't always come out the way you want."
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,39,Sometimes you're gonna have to step in... Stop.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,40,When you find your team in troubled waters... Stop.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,41,"No. Stan, stop it."
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,42,Knock it the fuck off!
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,43,Hey!
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,44,What the hell's going on here?
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,45,He's acting like he's throwing fake water at us.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,46,What?
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,47,"Because you said we're mortal enemies, and I didn't wanna say I wrecked his orgy."
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,48,Not why.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,49,I'm doing it because they tell me to stop.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,50,Then stop doing it!
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,51,I'll do it more!
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,52,Stop!
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,53,Stan!
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,54,"Stan, that's enough!"
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,55,Stop it!
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,56,Stop!
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,57,I'm just gonna keep doing it.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,58,"You wanna do it, let's do it!"
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,59,Alex! Alex!
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,60,What are you doing?
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,61,Alex!
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,62,I'm so tired of this!
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,63,Everything's out of control!
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,64,What is even going on?
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,65,My life is out of control.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,66,I just take everything way too far.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,67,I got too hyper.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,68,"And now you're more in trouble than me, unfortunately."
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,69,Yeah.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,70,It's okay.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,71,Yeah.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,72,Yeah.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,73,You got me with the water pretty bad.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,74,"Nah, nah, nah."
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,75,Nah.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,76,It's just that mine didn't have any water in it.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,77,And yours did.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,78,"And then, plus, you pulled my hair plugs."
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,79,That's why mine was funny and everyone's mad at you.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,80,I can't believe all that happened 'cause the teacher.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,81,I'm not a teacher.
61,Mortal Enemies,mortal-enemies,3,1,82,Wow!
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,1,Last week on Summer Loving Megan was torn between sending home two of the summer lovers.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,2,"Alexander and Ronnie, please step forward."
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,3,Find out whose summer break is over on this week's Summer Loving.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,4,Twenty-four eligible men spend summer break with one beautiful woman to see if a summer fling will turn into summer love.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,5,"Alexander, on our kayaking date earlier, I feel like there were a lot of awkward pauses."
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,6,"I know we had an instant attraction, but I'm starting to think we don't have enough in common for you to be the one."
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,7,"And Ronnie, I feel like you're just here for the zip line."
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,8,What?
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,9,All you do all day is go on the zip line.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,10,I like that you can drop into the pool.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,11,I'm trying to remember.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,12,"You were never joining us at any of the group meals and when you were reprimanded and asked to join us, you ate as fast as you could."
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,13,How do you think your connection is?
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,14,Good.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,15,"And you've gotten into several fights with Mike from Adventure 365, who runs the zip line."
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,16,Just too excited.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,17,He's too rough on the rope.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,18,"Shut up, Mike."
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,19,He pulls.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,20,He wrenches on the rope.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,21,He thinks it's his.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,22,"Shut up, Mike."
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,23,You yanked on the rope hard.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,24,I said shut up.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,25,"And is it true that when you found out I was upset about the zip line, you started spreading rumors about your fellow summer lovers?"
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,26,I sincerely believe Cody is a drug addict.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,27,Cody says he's never touched a drug.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,28,"Well, that's what I believe."
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,29,"Megan, before you decide whether to send me home or not, I just want you to know Carmelo said your face looks like a clock."
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,30,I never said that.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,31,I just don't wanna go home.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,32,What's waiting for me at home is really bad.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,33,What's waiting at home?
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,34,I don't know.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,35,"When I get home, there's something I'm worried about about my life."
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,36,What is it?
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,37,I don't know.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,38,Is there really something?
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,39,I don't know.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,40,I just really wanna be here.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,41,I love you.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,42,"Is it true, when having beers with Kenny, you told him it was your dream to be alone?"
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,43,It's not true.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,44,I just wanna be alone forever.
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,45,"Before you make your decision, I just want you to know I believe Carlos is a ho."
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,46,"I may falter Unfortunately, Ronnie You said this would happen our summer fling is over."
62,Summer Loving,summer-loving,3,1,47,Aww!

74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,28,Don't worry about that.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,29,All right.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,30,Then I'll shut up about it.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,31,No worries.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,32,I can't believe they catered this.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,33,The guy was so nice.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,34,We told him who you were.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,35,We described you.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,36,He knew right away.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,37,"He said, ""That guy?"
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,38,"I love that guy."""
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,39,Amazing.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,40,I do go there a lot.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,41,"Light the lights, frost the cake Line the presents up so great Sing the song, smile the smile Today's your day, we're gonna go wild Wild on, wild on Tonight we go wild on Tonight we go crazy"
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,42,"Hey, Candy?"
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,43,"Oh, hi, Robert."
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,44,How you doing?
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,45,Ha...
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,46,Happy birthday.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,47,I'm okay.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,48,Been meaning to talk to you about what happened last week.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,49,I shouldn't have spoken to you like that.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,50,"Oh, no, I didn't even think twice about it."
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,51,"Well, even if you haven't thought about it, I'm sorry I was so quick to say you weren't allowed to bring in your rats."
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,52,I appreciate that.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,53,I may have treated you unfairly when Steven brought in his dog and I didn't come down on him nearly as hard as I came down on you when you brought in four rats.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,54,Dogs are to Steven what rats are to me.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,55,Understood.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,56,'Cause I'm the rat mom.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,57,Yeah.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,58,"Well, it's not for me to decide which animals are worse than others."
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,59,Right.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,60,Because it's so easy for me to open the desk drawer.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,61,They're in there.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,62,"I take the food, put it on the desk."
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,63,I knock it in.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,64,No one knows I have rats.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,65,"Either way, shouldn't have said that."
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,66,"Maybe I'm a little bit hard on you because I see you rising at this place, and I could see you helping to manage it one day."
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,67,"Thank you, Robert."
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,68,I...
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,69,So that's all.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,70,I...
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,71,I just wanted to say sorry.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,72,And Merry Christmas.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,73,Merry Christmas.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,74,And happy birthday.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,75,Thank you.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,76,Thanks.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,77,Okay.
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,78,"Light the lights, frost the cake Line the presents up so great Sing the song, smile the smile Today's your day, we're gonna go wild Wild on, wild on Tonight we go wild on Tonight we go crazy..."
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,79,Oh my God!
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,80,I drank fucking dog shit!
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,81,Who put dog shit in a cup?!
74,Rat Mom,rat-mom,3,3,82,Who did it?!
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,1,Can't believe this place was near the office all that time and none of us knew.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,2,"Yeah, my salad is lights out."
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,3,This is so my new spot.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,4,"Oh my God, you hear about Jenna?"
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,5,What happened?
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,6,She took her mom to a play this weekend and her mom fell coming out the theater.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,7,"Oh God, is she okay?"
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,8,She's fine.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,9,She's just on bedrest for three weeks in Jenna's living room.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,10,Oof.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,11,"Christ, that's awful."
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,12,Yeah.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,13,I would not wanna be Jenna right now.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,14,Me either.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,15,I wouldn't wanna be Jenna either.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,16,Now Jenna has to take care of her mom...
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,17,I'd wanna be Mike.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,18,Just 'cause Mike has the best friend group.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,19,Yeah.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,20,Totally.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,21,Jenna's not coming in at all this week.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,22,She has to prep at home without her team.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,23,"Man, that is rough."
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,24,That's why I wanna be Mike.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,25,"His friend group has a smooth rhythm, all orchestrated perfectly by Mike."
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,26,"Yeah, it's a good group of guys."
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,27,"Yeah, my friend group is a good group of guys too."
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,28,It's 200 guys.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,29,Wow.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,30,Yeah.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,31,So I'm thinking about going over to Jenna's and seeing if her and her mom need food.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,32,That's nice.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,33,I just feel bad.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,34,I think the main problem of my friend group is I have to pay to be in it.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,35,You have to pay to be in your group?
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,36,Like a service.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,37,I was second tier.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,38,But then I was annoying at a party
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,39,so now I'm paying the most.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,40,What'd you do?
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,41,Thought it'd be funny to be a wild man in the pool.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,42,What do you mean?
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,43,I was fighting everybody and trying to splash water in their mouths.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,44,So now I pay more.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,45,Stuart.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,46,Should not have to pay for being...
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,47,Crap!
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,48,One of my friends!
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,49,Did he see what I was eating?
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,50,Are you in trouble?
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,51,"Come here right now, Stuart!"
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,52,Hey.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,53,How many friend parties did you go to this week?
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,54,Three.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,55,And how many parties are you allowed at your tier?
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,56,Two.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,57,"Then why, oh, why, Stuart, were you at a third party?"
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,58,I rented the house for the party!
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,59,Hey!
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,60,We don't yell at me.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,61,You're right.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,62,You're right.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,63,What were you eating over there?
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,64,Nothing.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,65,It was something healthy.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,66,Let's take a little walk.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,67,I wanna talk to your buddies.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,68,I'm gonna ask for myself.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,69,Okay.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,70,Hi.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,71,How are ya?
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,72,I'm Stuart's friend.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,73,Can you guys tell me what he ate?
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,74,I really didn't notice.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,75,Don't know.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,76,Can you do me a huge favor?
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,77,Make sure he doesn't eat too much.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,78,"See, Stuart's a lot more annoying when he's heavier."
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,79,Not really our business.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,80,Just a favor.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,81,Just a little favor.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,82,Whoa!
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,83,Who are you?
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,84,You have friends?

75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,87,No.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,88,You don't have friends.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,89,I do.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,90,They good friends?
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,91,How would you like 200 friends?
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,92,Just like this!
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,93,Oh my God.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,94,Sorry.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,95,It's okay.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,96,It's okay.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,97,You're okay.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,98,Everyone farts.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,99,"It's just when I slammed my two hands down, I squoze and farted."
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,100,You're okay.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,101,You'll be fine.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,102,It's just really bad.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,103,I know.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,104,I know it is.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,105,It's okay.
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,106,Want a little drink of water?
75,Friend Group,friend-group,3,4,107,All right.

76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,1,"Ever since I was a kid, I've always loved love."
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,2,I love celebrating each part.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,3,Will you marry me?
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,4,That's why I opened Pacific Proposal Park.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,5,The perfect place to propose.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,6,"Gardens and gardens of flowers, bubbling brooks, lighted gazebos, rose arches, as well as a special spongy soft soil... perfect for the most perfect kneel of your life."
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,7,"And unfortunately, the perfect place to slam Jerry ""the Jet"" Jones to the ground."
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,8,Will you marry me?
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,9,Oh my God!
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,10,These fuck in' wrestlers keep coming in and practicing slams on proposal ground!
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,11,I accidentally built the perfect ring.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,12,I built this for love.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,13,"Now, Toilet Truck made someone pretend he's a truck!"
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,14,You're a truck!
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,15,Vroom!
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,16,"You can't be here, Toilet Truck!"
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,17,No!
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,18,Fuckers!
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,19,"Please, stop!"
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,20,I was excited to propose to my girlfriend of three years on Proposal Park's soft lawn.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,21,"When I kneeled, Baby Duff came out of a bush and bit me on the leg."
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,22,Worst is Toilet Truck and Baby Duff.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,23,I hope Toilet Truck dies.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,24,I honestly hope he dies.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,25,I hope Toilet Truck dies.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,26,I hope Baby Duff dies.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,27,I hope somebody finds them and kills them.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,28,Another thing.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,29,King Larry... is also Scarecrow.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,30,Saw him change into Scarecrow in his car.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,31,I saw his whole pen is.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,32,And it was redder than hell.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,33,That's what I'm looking at.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,34,A guy's pen is that's about to pop.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,35,I don't think he washes himself.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,36,So please come and have the most beautiful proposal of your life.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,37,"Come on, King Larry."
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,38,You gotta go.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,39,All right.
76,Pacific Proposal Park,pacific-proposal-park,3,4,40,Did your pen is just pop?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,1,Self-conscious about your hair loss?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,2,Yeah.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,3,I don't know what to do.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,4,"Like as soon as I hit 40, it started thinning."
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,5,I had the same problem.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,6,You did?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,7,Yeah.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,8,Then I tried Gelutol.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,9,"After three weeks, I saw significant growth."
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,10,"After five weeks, I almost had my whole full head of hair back."
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,11,After just five weeks?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,12,Yes.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,13,It works.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,14,Trust me.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,15,And it's the only non-topical hair-replacement product that doesn't use IDL benzyl.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,16,Hey.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,17,You guys talking about Gelutol?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,18,No.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,19,What are you talking about then?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,20,Don't tell him.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,21,Nothing.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,22,What was he saying to you?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,23,Don't tell him.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,24,What were you talking about?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,25,sex.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,26,"After five weeks, you'll have a full head of hair."
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,27,Why didn't you tell him?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,28,Don't like him.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,29,I don't want him to have hair.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,30,So take one of these every day.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,31,"In two weeks, you'll start to see results."
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,32,Thank you.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,33,Gelutol.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,34,Enjoy a healthy head of hair that looks like you never lost it.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,35,You talking shit about me?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,36,What?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,37,No.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,38,What were you talking about?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,39,Were you really talking about sex?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,40,Yeah.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,41,Fingering.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,42,Really?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,43,Not gonna tell you anything.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,44,Why?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,45,You're not cool at all.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,46,You're a dick.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,47,Leave us alone.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,48,Gonna tell him something he can't tell.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,49,fuck do I care?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,50,What'd he say?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,51,"""Fingering."""
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,52,What are you doing?!
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,53,"Results vary, but in laboratory studies hair growth began in under two weeks."
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,54,Shh!
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,55,Here he comes.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,56,What were you talking about?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,57,Get out of here.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,58,About my wife?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,59,'Cause she's not wearing green?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,60,She had a green jacket.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,61,Took it off.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,62,She got hot.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,63,Go away from me right now.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,64,He thinks we're talking about his wife.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,65,Gotta put this on.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,66,Why?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,67,Right now.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,68,St. Patrick's Day.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,69,I'm so hot.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,70,Drink water.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,71,I think I want you to have curly hair.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,72,My hair grows in straight.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,73,You could curl it.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,74,I gave you the stuff.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,75,Don't you think I should have a little say in how it is?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,76,Bobby!
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,77,"In a controlled study of men ages 40-65, over 85% of participants experienced partial to complete hair restoration."
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,78,Women who are or may potentially be pregnant must not use or handle broken tablets.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,79,Who is that?
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,80,Guy who has that car.
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,81,What are you talking about?!
77,Gelutol,gelutol,3,4,82,Getting killed!

81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,49,I could've been Barney.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,50,How?
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,51,Could've been like Barney's hair.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,52,"""Hey, look at me, I'm Barney, like Barney's hair."""
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,53,Barney doesn't have hair.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,54,Will you shut up?
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,55,He's like cloth.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,56,Cloth is hairs.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,57,It's little tiny hairs.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,58,Even his mouth has little hairs.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,59,"I mean, he's cloth!"
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,60,Cloth is just little hairs.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,61,I should've never done silly.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,62,"Got too much going on, business-wise."
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,63,What are you even talking about?
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,64,He has hair.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,65,Give me the fuck in' shutter shades.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,66,Gonna do another one.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,67,Hey!
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,68,Where are you going?
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,69,To relax!
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,70,I already had my picture taken with the star.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,71,I like what I did.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,72,Don't have business deals on the line.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,73,I do!
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,74,A ton!
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,75,I have 15 investors for the Pelling Ball.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,76,What the fuck is the Pelling Ball?
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,77,It's a game.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,78,Doesn't sound fun.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,79,Okay.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,80,Had six dinners with Bart Lee 'cause Pelling Ball's not fun!
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,81,Who is Bart Lee?
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,82,Heard of John Richter?
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,83,No.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,84,You know nothing about games.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,85,Knowing about games isn't cool.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,86,Stop!
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,87,Stop doing that!
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,88,You stop that right now!
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,89,Stop it!
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,90,Stop it!
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,91,Stop it!
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,92,Stop doing that right now.
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,93,Stop doing that dance!
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,94,You stop that!
81,Photo Booth,photo-booth,3,5,95,Yep.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,1,Right?
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,2,It's so nice you live this close.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,3,Yeah.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,4,I was so pumped they chose to do the convention in Cleveland.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,5,Don't have to travel.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,6,Can walk right to the panels.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,7,And a great chance to have a house party.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,8,Mm-hm!
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,9,First Saturday I don't have to get up at 6:00 a.m. and take my kids to soccer.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,10,They're getting good at soccer though.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,11,"I mean, my..."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,12,Sorry.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,13,"There I go, talking about my kids."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,14,"Oh, yeah."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,15,Do me a favor.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,16,"Next time, please stop me."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,17,I know.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,18,Thank you.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,19,Will do.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,20,Totally.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,21,Okay.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,22,Did anyone go to the...
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,23,You got it.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,24,Okay.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,25,Know the one I'm looking forward to?
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,26,Don't worry.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,27,You're not gonna talk about your kids an ounce.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,28,We should go together.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,29,I'd love to read it.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,30,I would too.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,31,The West Coast has just better snow.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,32,I think I'm too old.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,33,"Scared I'm gonna tear my ACL, you know."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,34,But my kids love the snow.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,35,My daughter goes flying down in a little ski suit.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,36,"Hey, everybody!"
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,37,Look at me!
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,38,I'm riding the dog!
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,39,"You really do always wanna do this, don't you?"
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,40,Do what?
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,41,Talk kids.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,42,I stopped you by pretending to ride that beautiful dog.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,43,Yeah.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,44,It's all right.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,45,It's all right.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,46,Just don't fuck with me again!
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,47,From Tower of Money.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,48,"Hey, leave the dog alone!"
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,49,"Come on, leave the dog alone."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,50,Leave it alone.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,51,Get away.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,52,Go outside.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,53,I love Miami.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,54,It's a night club culture.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,55,It's great.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,56,I was there last spring.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,57,Did you go by yourself?
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,58,Um... I took my kids.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,59,Goddammit!
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,60,"Hey, everybody!"
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,61,Hey!
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,62,Hey!
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,63,What you doing?
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,64,Wasn't talking about them.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,65,You did.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,66,Not something wrong with me.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,67,Don't have to keep doing this.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,68,I always do what I say.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,69,"All right, break it up."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,70,Knock it off.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,71,It's dumb.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,72,It's dumb.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,73,Who the fuck is this guy?
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,74,"Oh my God, I follow your wife on Instagram."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,75,Uh-huh.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,76,Your kids are so cute.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,77,What's your daughter's name again?
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,78,I can't say.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,79,"It starts with a V, right?"
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,80,Just drop it.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,81,What?
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,82,"Yes, her name is Vega. motherfucker!"
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,83,"Hey, everybody, look, the dog's blowing me."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,84,"Look, everybody, the dog's blowing me."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,85,"What the hell, man?"
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,86,I keep having to do wild stuff to stop you talking about your kids!
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,87,Now you made me too popular here!
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,88,What?
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,89,Now everybody loves me too much.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,90,I wanna do it.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,91,"Guys keep coming to me, saying, ""What's the next wild thing we're gonna do?"""
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,92,Isn't anything more interesting about you than your kids?
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,93,I'll try.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,94,"Please, try!"
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,95,I'm the most popular guy here now!
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,96,"Was talking about taking a shower, then I get an ad for Dove soap."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,97,Reading the news.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,98,"On the side, ads keep popping up for PAW Patrol lunchboxes."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,99,You must have kids too.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,100,"Well, I..."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,101,What are we doing next?
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,102,I don't want it to be another dance.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,103,I don't know.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,104,Let's do something.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,105,Just relax!
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,106,Uh... Let's talk about something else.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,107,What...
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,108,What should we talk about?
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,109,What's the craziest thing you've ever done?
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,110,"Oh, wow."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,111,Okay.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,112,Okay.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,113,So I'm strapped into this instructor's lap.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,114,Who looks like Eddie Van Halen.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,115,"I look at him and say, ""I'm a bit nervous."""
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,116,"He says, ""You should be."""
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,117,"""We're going way too fast."""
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,118,"Guys, leave the dog alone."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,119,We're not doing anything with the dog.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,120,Leave the dog alone.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,121,Push the dog.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,122,No!
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,123,Should we push the walls?
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,124,What are you even talking about?
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,125,Tell us what to do!
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,126,Stand on our heads?
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,127,I don't know.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,128,Let me think.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,129,Let me think.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,130,Hurry!
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,131,Just a ripoff of Kurosawa.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,132,Bullshit.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,133,I'll convince you.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,134,You go first.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,135,Your 20 seconds are on the board.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,136,"Wow, official."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,137,Everything I do is official when I wanna win.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,138,I gotta get another drink.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,139,"Getting drinks, guys!"
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,140,No.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,141,I'm getting a drink.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,142,By myself!
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,143,All getting drinks by ourselves!
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,144,"You, there."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,145,"You, there."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,146,"You, over there."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,147,Yeah.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,148,Too close to me.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,149,No! Let me think!
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,150,"Telling you, back in my day, I could square up."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,151,"In my neighborhood, had to be able to fight."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,152,Can only imagine.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,153,Just wanna tell you you're doing great work.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,154,"Thank you, sir."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,155,Doesn't hurt that you party too.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,156,What do you think we'll do next?
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,157,Don't know.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,158,What about this?
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,159,Is this something?
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,160,"No, let me think a minute."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,161,I'll think of it.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,162,It was my birthday yesterday.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,163,I turned 43.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,164,Happy birthday.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,165,My brother's 41.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,166,It's my birthday in ten days.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,167,What you texting?
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,168,I'm just texting something.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,169,Don't grab me!
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,170,I can't see.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,171,Get away from me.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,172,Go!
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,173,I'll think of something!
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,174,Let's go do something.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,175,I ain't doing a dance.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,176,"Hey, man."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,177,I just want to say I had such a good time not talking about my kids.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,178,Great.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,179,Glad I could help.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,180,Got deeper than ever with people.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,181,I used to talk about my kids all the time.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,182,It's all I had to talk about.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,183,You talk about your son your whole life.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,184,"Then one day he goes to the zoo, puts his hands through the bars, and shoots Godzilla the gorilla."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,185,What?
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,186,Godzilla the gorilla.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,187,The gorilla that would eat kids' hats for his trick.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,188,He...
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,189,Why'd he shoot him?
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,190,"Such a big fan of him, he wanted to own his life or something."
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,191,It's why I felt so bad about the dog.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,192,I've put enough animal hurt in the world by having my son.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,193,Yeah.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,194,Thank you.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,195,Yeah.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,196,Hey.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,197,I'm sorry about that.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,198,I'm sorry I said you were a buckin' bronco and that you were blowing me.
82,House Party,house-party,3,5,199,What about this?
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,1,I'm gonna show a quick scenario that has right and wrong answers.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,2,Just shout them out and we'll discuss them.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,3,Hey.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,4,So I had to take Barney to that lunch meeting.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,5,I know you're still working on that project.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,6,Do you mind giving half the credit to Barney as well?
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,7,Hmm...
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,8,Obviously she's been put in an uncomfortable situation.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,9,What are things she could say?
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,10,"""Back away, banana breath."
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,11,What the hell did you just eat?
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,12,"A banana?"""
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,13,I'm sure that's what she'd like to say.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,14,Totally.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,15,What are some ways she can handle it?
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,16,Go to HR.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,17,Sure.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,18,What else?
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,19,"Could say, ""I'm not comfortable."""
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,20,"Or ""I don't want to do that."""
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,21,A boundary.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,22,Good.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,23,"By vocalizing them, you can give others a chance to reevaluate their actions."
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,24,Boundaries are a wonderful way to help build trust... ...
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,25,"uh, and mutually respectful relationships."
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,26,Need to go outside?
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,27,I'm okay.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,28,I'm... just laughing.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,29,"Uh, in this next clip..."
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,30,You okay?
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,31,Yeah.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,32,I'm gonna be really great.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,33,"""Back away, banana breath."""
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,34,"""What the hell did you just eat?"
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,35,"A banana?"""
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,36,I'm gonna be really great.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,37,So I just have...
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,38,I have something to say.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,39,Okay.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,40,I think we should do shirts for this class.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,41,What's that?
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,42,A fun shirt.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,43,That we design.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,44,"That says, ""HR, Class of 2023."""
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,45,"And underneath, it says, ""Back away, banana breath."""
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,46,I'm glad you've enjoyed it.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,47,But this is to address something serious going on in this office.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,48,Oh yeah.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,49,I know.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,50,"It's just been a really good time, and I'm going to do the shirts."
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,51,All right.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,52,But I want to re-emphasize the value of proper documentation.
83,Banana Breath,banana-breath,3,6,53,The best way to avoid...

84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,3,Each of those metal panels has a colored dot in the right-hand corner.
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,4,"Soon as you pick a panel, Metaloid Maniac will zip around the magnetic metal board he built and take down the metal panel, revealing a piece of the photo of the phrase."
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,5,"But pick dots quickly because the Metaloid Maniac is fast and he will speed around the board, filling in empty spots with metal on the wall that he built."
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,6,Okay?
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,7,Let's play Metal Motto Search.

84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,11,Some of the Batter Birds took some metaloid tiles guarding our phrase!
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,12,Shouldn't be a problem for me.
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,13,"Metal, metal, metal, metal, metal, metal, metal..."
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,14,"Metaloid Maniac, slow down!"
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,15,"You're moving so fast, it's gonna crack the planet!"
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,16,"Metal, metal, metal!"

84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,25,"He's zipping around, crazily."
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,26,The reason the Metaloid Maniac is so comfortable up there is 'cause he built that wall.
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,27,He's naturally magnetized which allows him to zip around the wall that he built.
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,28,Practically frictionless.
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,29,What you think?

84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,33,First thing I thought of when I thought of Metaloid Maniac...
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,34,"What if there was a guy who could, like, uh, zip around with metal, and also shoot it and build stuff with it?"
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,35,So fucking cool.
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,36,The Metaloid Maniac has removed one metal tile.
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,37,Underneath is a white square with a black line coming from the bottom.
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,38,It could be an elbow of an L. Or could be the top of an L. Anyone wanna guess?
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,39,No guesses.

84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,47,Let me go have a chat with the Metaloid Maniac.
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,48,Make sure I ain't got metal on me.
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,49,Not doing it.
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,50,What? Metaloid Maniac!

84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,57,"See, this wall is his ground."
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,58,Any way we can make it look like this wall is your ground?
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,59,No.
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,60,"There's no way to do that, Dan."

84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,68,I can't get around at all.
84,Photo Wall of Metal: Metal Motto Search,photo-wall-of-metal-metal-motto-search,3,6,69,What's really going on?
