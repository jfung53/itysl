Don't know if we're gonna have enough GOTV buses for this weekend without Mike Flaherty. Okay. This isn't the first time Mike flaked. Concerns me come primary day. I don't know what other options we have. I asked Lynn to quietly check with George Faust if he's willing to help. I'd love not to go down that road. You could talk to him, but I know him more than anyone so I don't know what'll help. Let me think. Thank you for bringing it to my attention. Oh, thank you. All right. Everybody all in? Everybody good? Let's go. Get motivated. Fifteen days. Fifteen days. All right! I'm mad at you. What? I'm mad at you! You're not following me on Instagram. Oh. Didn't know you were on there. I'm on there. I'll look. I'll find you. It's okay. I followed myself from your phone. You followed yourself from my phone? What the hell is this? Tasty Time Vids. Me. Check it out. I post funny stuff. New videos starting today. Every Friday. Every Friday! Rain or shine, a new funny video. Don't worry. Cool. Yeah, I'll check it out, Draven. Yeah, you will 'cause you follow me. Thanks for the follow, fan. All right, cool. Yeah. Gonna move boxes, but first a word with you. The hell you doing, you little asshat? You little stupid fucking piece of shit. Shut up. Okay. All right. Gonna be looking for you on the computer. New vid dropped. Watch it right now. In the morning. Watch! Wow. That was really amazing. Glad I met you at the bar. What the fuck is this? You should go. I think I just slept with Frankenstein's chick! Oh no! Tasty Time Videos every Friday. It's great. Thank you for encouraging me. Thank you for believing in me, David. New video next Friday! fuck! Hey, Draven, Draven, Draven! What is going on? I can't fucking think of anything! Anything for what? For this video! I can't think of anything funny. Don't know what I'm gonna do. Probably be okay. They're coming after me in the comments! The woman that played Frankenstein's chick is saying I... paid her in fast food. Saying I paid her in a Santa Fe chicken sandwich. Why are they saying you paid in fast food? Why would they say that? 'Cause I did! I don't know how to do this stuff. I'm... I'm so dead. I don't know what to do, man. You're responsible for me on some level. You encouraged me. I don't know how to help. fuck! Draven! Draven! Draven! fucking shit! David. I am so worried about this video. Just made it! Phew! I slept with Frankenstein's chick! Oh no! Frankenstein's Chick Sped Up. Pays in Santa Fe sandwich. Pays in fast food. Gonna kill this guy's parents. Gonna murder his dad. Paid her in pencil fries. I wanna kill his mom. Oh my God. See the vid? Did you see it? Yeah. Yeah! Frankenstein's Chick, sped up twice as fast. It worked! Yes. See they wanna kill my parents? Yeah, I saw that. I saw that. Saying they're gonna cut my dad's head off. Jesus. Frankenstein's chick and her manager are coming after me. They want to take my account away. Telling everybody I paid her in Arby's. You did. Goddammit! This is your fault. How? When you gave me your phone. Shouldn't give your phone to people you don't really know. Plus I'm frozen. Zero ideas. I can't think of what I'm gonna do next. And I can't think of any ideas! Oh my God! This is your fault. You encouraged me. You're responsible for me. Cut my dad's head off. I'm fucking dead. It's all over, David. Don't be scared. Don't be sad. Watch this. You're being crazy, Frankenstein. I didn't cheat! What's this then? Uh-oh. Hey, everyone. I'm the new owner of Tasty Time Vids. She's Frankenstein's chick and I'm her manager. Jesus Christ. The hell is this? I gave away Tasty Time Vids. Did it for my dad. No one's ever getting this head. No one's ever cutting off my daddy's head. I love my daddy. Me and papa. Does your dad smoke? We should hang out.\""
